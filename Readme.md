Use Case Scenario
When you're using a secondary monitor (which is usually off and only turned on for gaming or watching movies), and you want to quickly put your computer to sleep, but you also want the login screen to appear on your primary monitor (your computer's main display) when you wake it up, you need to switch back to your primary monitor before sleeping. Otherwise, the next time you turn on your computer, you might not be able to log in (because the login screen could appear on the secondary monitor).

How to Use
Download this .bat file, edit and set the target display, icon, and so on, then run it. This script will create a shortcut on your desktop. Each time you run this shortcut, it will switch to the specified display and then put your computer to sleep.
